Job Description:
 
This resource will be entirely focused on the building out of Windows servers. The existing team is spread thin with their other duties (maintenance of existing servers and database) and there is an existing backlog of work needed to be done. The backlog of work includes the need to have 300 new VMs built out. 

This resource will be entirely focused on the server builds and will not be involved in meetings, internal politics or any other tasks.
 
About me:
I'm the one who wants to be your Director of IT.
* Rebuilt the Summitnet NOC at Reliance.
* Led the migration of Reliance from Datacenter to Sterling's Cloud.
* Upgraded Reliance Production from IIS6 to IIS8.5.
* Upgraded Reliance Corporate from 32bit Win7 to 64bit Win7, C2D to i5, 8GB to 16GB, HDD to SSD.
* Knows each of your servers personally - their history, their role, their components, their specs, and their needs. 
* Has the entire domain in his head. Name an error, I can tell you the server that's causing it. And the servers that are down from it, what it does to our sites, and how to fix it, both short term and long term.
* Highly experienced with non-deterministic non-linear widely-distributed computing systems
* Goes looking for problems in your systems, so they can be identified, resolved, and documented in case they happen again.
* I babysit the worst problems in the company.
* Learns all parts of your business to support and help everywhere I can!
* By 6 months in, I'll be providing so much value that you'll wonder what you ever did without me.

Strengths & weaknesses:
-People skills don't come naturally, it's a journey.
-I'm a know it all, and that can be annoying on a team
-I'm obsessed with being right. This means I'll change my opinion when I'm wrong, just so I continue to be right. And I'm not afraid to correct teammates. and superiors.
